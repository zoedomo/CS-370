**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

In this project, I was provided with starter code for implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm for a treasure hunt game. The given code included classes for representing the maze environment, game experience, and helper functions for visualization. Additionally, there were instructions and skeleton code for implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm, including the Q-training function.
The code I created myself involved completing the implementation of the deep Q-learning algorithm within the qtrain function. This involved filling in the missing parts of the algorithm, such as selecting actions, updating the experience replay, training the neural network model, and monitoring the training process.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

Computer scientists tackle complex problems by analyzing requirements, designing algorithms, and implementing solutions. In this project, I approached the problem by understanding the requirements for implementing deep Q-learning, designing an algorithm to train a model to navigate a maze, and implementing the solution in Python code.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

As a computer scientist, approaching a problem involves a structured and systematic approach aimed at understanding, analyzing, and solving the problem effectively. Initially, I would thoroughly understand the problem domain and requirements, clarifying any issues and defining clear objectives. Next, I would analyze the problem, breaking it down into smaller, manageable components, and identifying key challenges, constraints, and dependencies. With a clear understanding of the problem, I would then design algorithms and data structures to address the requirements, ensuring efficiency, scalability, and correctness. 

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities to both end users and organizations. To end users, it means guaranteeing their privacy, security, and fairness. I must be transparent about how their data is used, keep it safe, and avoid creating biased algorithms. For organizations, it involves maintaining professionalism, following laws, and being honest about the technology's capabilities and risks. It's about doing the right thing for both users and the organization and being accountable for my actions.
